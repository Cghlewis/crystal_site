I know education data. I've personally collected data through classroom observations, student assessments, teacher surveys, and more. I have experienced the pain points of data collection and have seen the consequences of neglecting data management. Through those experiences, I found my passion for data management and I have spent years learning best practices and how to implement them. If you talk to anyone who knows me, they will confirm how much I love talking about and working on data management problems. For me, it is such a rewarding experience, helping education researchers implement quality practices that allow them to shift more of their focus on using data to make a positive impact on students, teachers, and communities, and less on how to organize and secure their research study data.

I currently provide a variety of data management services as a freelance consultant. If you are looking for help in any of the areas below, contact me to learn about rates and availability. I look forward to hearing from you!
