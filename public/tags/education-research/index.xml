      <description>I recently had a discussion with a colleague about assigning unique participant identifiers in their study. In that discussion I learned that my opinion on how researchers should assign identifiers happened to be very different from how this colleague was assigning identifiers. This discussion then prompted me to question my assumptions about how I manage data (which I appreciate)! :)
For several hours after this discussion I scoured the internet for any advice, research, or opinions on how participant identifiers should be assigned.</description>
