      <description>About the Book This book is a compilation of lessons I have learned in my personal experiences as a data manager, knowledge collected from existing books, sites and blogs (many written by librarians or those involved in the open science movement), as well as advice and stories collected through interviews with other researchers who work with data. This book covers best practices throughout the research data management life cycle that education researchers and research staff can implement into their workflow.</description>

      <title>Example data repository</title>
      <link>https://cghlewis.com/projects/repo/</link>

      <description>About the repository This project provides an example of the data products a researcher may choose to publicly share at the end of a research project. The files a researcher shares and how they share them will depend on their specific project and requirements (e.g., funder requirements, data reuse considerations). However, this repository provides just one example of how education researchers may consider organizing data products in a repository.</description>

      <description>Codebook Comparison I started this table as a way to compare existing r packages that assist in codebook creation. The criteria I am looking for include the following variable level metrics (specifically for working with haven::labelled() data):
Name Label Type Values (if categorical) Value labels (if categorical) NA values (Missing values: for example -99 and -98) NA labels (Missing value labels: for example -99 = No response, -98 = Unclear response) Total valid N Total missing N N per value (if categorical) % per value (if categorical) N per NA value (Missing value) % per NA value (Missing value) Range (if continuous) Mean (if continuous) A table of all packages I reviewed can be found here: https://cghlewis.</description>
