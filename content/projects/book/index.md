## About the Book

This book is a compilation of lessons I have learned in my personal experiences as a data manager, knowledge collected from existing books, sites and blogs (many written by librarians or those involved in the open science movement), as well as advice and stories collected through interviews with other researchers who work with data. This book covers best practices throughout the research data management life cycle that education researchers and research staff can implement into their workflow.
