      <description>In the previous two posts of this series we reviewed how to standardize the steps in our data cleaning process, as well as practices we can implement to make our workflow more reproducible and reliable. In this final post of the series, I attempt to answer the question, &amp;ldquo;What does this data cleaning standardized workflow look like when implemented in the real world?&amp;rdquo;. To tackle this question I created a very simple sample dataset based on the following fictitious scenario:</description>

      <description>Data cleaning workflow Data cleaning is the process of organizing and transforming raw data into a format that can be easily interpreted and analyzed. In education research, we are often cleaning data collected in the field from methods such as surveys, assessments, tests, or forms.
Even if we collect data with the most well-designed collection tools, there is most likely at least some cleaning that is needed before you have a dataset that is ready to be shared within or outside of your team.</description>

      <description>Through various conversations over the last several months, a recurring question I keep hearing is, what makes a clean dataset? What steps do we expect someone to take before handing off a dataset that is considered &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo;? And I will tell you right now, there is no standard answer for this question. Even within fields, within projects, or within teams, you will get different answers depending on who you talk to, their role in the research cycle, and their past experiences and/or training with data.</description>
