      <description>Have you ever downloaded your data from a survey platform and expected it to look like this? ðŸ˜»
But instead you export data that looks like this? ðŸ™€

      <title>Using a data dictionary as your roadmap to quality data</title>

      <description>A data dictionary, a rectangular format collection of names, definitions, and attributes about variables in a dataset, is arguably the single most important piece of documentation you will create in your research study. While a data dictionary, sometimes also called a codebook or variable information log, is often used as a tool to help you and others interpret your data at the end of your project, it is actually even more powerful if created before you ever collect a single piece of data, serving as a roadmap as you design your data collection tools and clean your data, in order to ultimately get to where you want to go.</description>
