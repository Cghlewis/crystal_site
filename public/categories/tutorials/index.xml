      <description>In an earlier blog post I argued that data dictionaries are one of the most important pieces of documentation you can keep for a project and I spoke about the three purposes of a data dictionary. One of those purposes being that they can be used in your data cleaning process. And when I say &amp;ldquo;used&amp;rdquo;, I meant that in both a non-literal sense (for example I can refer to my data dictionary for guidance as to what transformations my data might need), but I also meant it in a very literal sense.</description>

      <description>Have you ever downloaded your data from a survey platform and expected it to look like this? ðŸ˜»
But instead you export data that looks like this? ðŸ™€
There are many issues with this data, ranging from unclear and inconsistent value entries, to vague variable names, to conflicting variable types, to multiple things being measured in one variable. While this data can still hopefully be salvaged, the time consuming, decision-heavy process that will go along with cleaning this data is an avoidable step in our data management process.</description>

      <description>A data dictionary, a rectangular format collection of names, definitions, and attributes about variables in a dataset, is arguably the single most important piece of documentation you will create in your research study. While a data dictionary, sometimes also called a codebook or variable information log, is often used as a tool to help you and others interpret your data at the end of your project, it is actually even more powerful if created before you ever collect a single piece of data, serving as a roadmap as you design your data collection tools and clean your data, in order to ultimately get to where you want to go.</description>
