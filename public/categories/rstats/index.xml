      <title>A Comparison of Packages to Generate Codebooks in R</title>
      <link>https://cghlewis.com/talk/rladies_nyc/</link>

      <description>These are materials for a 5 minute lightning talk I gave to R-Ladies NYC. The topic was comparing 4 R packages that can be used to create codebooks to document your data.
*Note: On 2022-12-12 I made a small update to the slides. I discovered that the codebookr::codebook() function did not create 2 of the summary statistics I originally thought it did. So the slides now reflect this finding.</description>

      <title>Data Wrangling Functions</title>

      <description>About the Wiki The Data Wrangling Functions Wiki is a reference resource that I have been developing for myself and others to refer to when cleaning education data (or any data) using R. It is a collection of functions that I have found helpful to use in my data wrangling process and can be referred to whenever you forget how to or are unsure how to perform a data task.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Available R Codebook Packages</title>

      <description>Codebook Comparison I started this table as a way to compare existing r packages that assist in codebook creation. The criteria I am looking for include the following variable level metrics (specifically for working with haven::labelled() data):
Name Label Type Values (if categorical) Value labels (if categorical) NA values (Missing values: for example -99 and -98) NA labels (Missing value labels: for example -99 = No response, -98 = Unclear response) Total valid N Total missing N N per value (if categorical) % per value (if categorical) N per NA value (Missing value) % per NA value (Missing value) Range (if continuous) Mean (if continuous) A table of all packages I reviewed can be found here: https://cghlewis.</description>
