## About the repository

This project provides an example of the data products a researcher may choose to publicly share at the end of a research project. The files a researcher shares and how they share them will depend on their specific project and requirements (e.g., funder requirements, data reuse considerations). However, this repository provides just one example of how education researchers may consider organizing data products in a repository.
