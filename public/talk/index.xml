      <title>A Comparison of Packages to Generate Codebooks in R</title>
      <link>https://cghlewis.com/talk/rladies_nyc/</link>

      <description>These are materials for a 5 minute lightning talk I gave to R-Ladies NYC. The topic was comparing 4 R packages that can be used to create codebooks to document your data.
*Note: On 2022-12-12 I made a small update to the slides. I discovered that the codebookr::codebook() function did not create 2 of the summary statistics I originally thought it did. So the slides now reflect this finding.</description>
