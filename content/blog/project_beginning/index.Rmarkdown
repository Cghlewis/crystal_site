This summer I've been consulting on some early phase education research projects. These are projects that have recently been funded and are going into their first year of data collection. The people I consult with have reached out because they really want to set up good data management practices early on, saving them from potentially having to clean up data disasters later on. Coming in as a consultant, rather than a full-time employee, I find that my role is really to narrow in on what are the core priorities. While I can list 100 different data management practices that I think are beneficial, my limited time on the project (and the limited time the team has to implement data management) means I really need to focus in on and choose a more narrow list of practices that I think *must* be implemented in order for data management to succeed. This prompted me to write this post. What are the core practices that I generally recommend teams to implement early on in their projects in order to successfully manage their data?

# Set up folder structure

- Set up structure, set up access

# Documentation

Many of the practices I prioritize revolve around documentation. Documentation can be created at many phases of a project, and serve many different purposes. In this early planning phase of a project though, the documentation that is most important to create is any project-level and dataset-level documentation that will help your team plan your data collection workflows. 

The first type of documentation I recommend is project-level documentation. These documents provide a common understanding for the team and can be used as a discussion piece for all planning discussions. 

## Team-level documentation

1. Roles and Responsibilities

## Project-level documentation

1. Data Instrument Inventory - including data security info

2. Data Collection Timeline

3. Style Guides

4. SOPs
- ID Schema
- Consent process

## Dataset-level documentation

1. Data dictionaries

# Tracking database

1. Entity table

# Consents

1. Consents contain language about data sharing
