description: I am currently doing freelance consulting in data management while taking time to work on a book titled Data Management in Large-Scale Education Research. After spending over eight years in the field of education research, I found that the most fulfilling part of my experience was helping researchers build and implement quality data management processes that allowed them to focus more on using their data to make positive changes in the field, and less time wrangling their data into a usable format. If you and your team are looking for data management services or training, I would love to work with you!
