description: Welcome! I am a freelance consultant and trainer with over 10 years of experience as a data manager in the field of education research. I am also the author of the book [Data Management in Large-Scale Education Research](https://datamgmtinedresearch.com/), which provides a holistic overview of how to manage research data throughout a project life cycle. If you are a researcher in the field of education, I can help you learn how to implement data management practices that will allow you to focus more on using your data to make positive changes in the field, and less time wrangling your data into a usable format. If you are tired of running research projects that result in unorganized or unusable data, I would love to work with you!
