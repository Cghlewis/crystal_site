Below are resources for those wanting to learn more about research data management. I have organized resources by type (papers, guides, slides, etc). There are MANY more resources than the ones listed below, but I have narrowed them down to those that I have found most helpful in understanding general best practices in data management and how to implement them into a research workflow.

*Resources were last updated on 2022/10/21* 

### Guides

These are guides that are helpful for understanding data management in the context of the entire research process.
