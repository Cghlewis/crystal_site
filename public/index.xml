      <description>So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve been leveraging GitHub Pages for publishing. This works great, but for blogdown we&amp;rsquo;ll start using Netlify. Let&amp;rsquo;s start RIGHT NOW with a site we&amp;rsquo;ve already built and published.
Pre-requisites Pick either your postcards site, or your distill site from day 01. Refresh your memory- which repository was it again?</description>

      <description>Welcome to the Introducing Yourself Online workshop! We look forward to meeting you. Before attending the workshop, please complete the following prework.
Set up RStudio Cloud Sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at https://rstudio.cloud/ before the workshop. I recommend logging in with an existing Google or GitHub account, if you have one (rather than creating a new account with another password you have to remember). I want you to be able to work from your own laptop in this workshop, but Cloud is an important back-up plan should you run into troubles.</description>

      <description>Working with data would be so much simpler if we always only had one dataset to work with. However, in the world of research, we often have multiple datasets, collected from different instruments, participants, or time periods, and our research questions typically require these data to be linked in some way. Yet, before combining data, it&amp;rsquo;s important to consider what type of join makes the most sense for our specific purposes, as well as how to correctly perform those joins.</description>

      <description>About the Book The modules and book are a compilation of lessons I have learned in my personal experiences as a data manager, knowledge collected from existing books, sites and blogs (many written by librarians or those involved in the open science movement), as well as advice and stories collected through interviews with other researchers who work with data. I cover best practices throughout the research data management life cycle that education researchers and research staff can implement into their workflow.</description>

      <description>If you were struck by lightning, would other people be able to access and understand your data? - Sarah Arena
Even with the growing open science movement, the expanding requirements for publicly sharing sharing federally funded data, and the ongoing news about data falsification motivating us to produce more accurate, documented, and reproducible data, many researchers are still not able to confidently say &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; to this question.
One solution to this problem is to hire a data manager.</description>

      <title>Creating unique participant study identifiers</title>

      <guid>https://cghlewis.com/blog/participant_id/</guid>
      <description>I recently had a discussion with a colleague about assigning unique participant identifiers in their study. In that discussion I learned that my opinion on how researchers should assign identifiers happened to be very different from how this colleague was assigning identifiers. This discussion then prompted me to question my assumptions about how I manage data (which I appreciate)! :)
For several hours after this discussion I scoured the internet for any advice, research, or opinions on how participant identifiers should be assigned.</description>

      <description>In the previous two posts of this series we reviewed how to standardize the steps in our data cleaning process to produce consistent datasets across the field of education research, as well as practices we can implement to make our data cleaning workflow more reproducible and reliable. In this final post of the series, I attempt to answer the question, &amp;ldquo;What does this process look like when implemented in the real world?</description>

      <description>Data cleaning workflow Data cleaning is the process of organizing and transforming raw data into a format that can be easily interpreted and analyzed. In education research, we are often cleaning data collected in the field from methods such as surveys, assessments, tests, or forms.
Even if we collect data with the most well-designed collection tools, there is most likely at least some cleaning that is needed before you have a dataset that is ready to be shared within or outside of your team.</description>

      <description>Through various conversations over the last several months, a recurring question I keep hearing is, what makes a clean dataset? What steps do we expect someone to take before handing off a dataset that is considered &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo;? And I will tell you right now, there is no standard answer for this question. Even within fields, within projects, or within teams, you will get different answers depending on who you talk to, their role in the research cycle, and their past experiences and/or training with data.</description>

      <title>Four simple ways to integrate your data dictionary into your data cleaning process</title>
      <link>https://cghlewis.com/blog/dict_clean/</link>

      <guid>https://cghlewis.com/blog/dict_clean/</guid>
      <description>In an earlier blog post I argued that data dictionaries are one of the most important pieces of documentation you can keep for a project and I spoke about the four purposes of a data dictionary. One of those purposes being that they can be integrated in your data cleaning process. And when I say &amp;ldquo;integrated&amp;rdquo;, I mean that in both a non-literal sense (for example I can refer to my data dictionary for guidance as to what transformations my data might need), but I also mean it in a very literal sense.</description>

      <description>Have you ever downloaded your data from a survey platform and expected it to look like this? 😻
But instead you export data that looks like this? 🙀
There are many issues with this data, ranging from unclear and inconsistent value entries, to vague variable names, to conflicting variable types, to multiple things being measured in one variable. While this data can still hopefully be salvaged, the time consuming, decision-heavy process that will go along with cleaning this data is an avoidable step in our data management process.</description>

      <title>Using a data dictionary as your roadmap to quality data</title>

      <guid>https://cghlewis.com/blog/data_dictionary/</guid>
      <description>A data dictionary, a rectangular format collection of names, definitions, and attributes about variables in a dataset, is arguably the single most important piece of documentation you will create in your research study. While a data dictionary, sometimes also called a codebook or variable information log, is often used as a tool to help you and others interpret your data at the end of your project, it is actually even more powerful if created before you ever collect a single piece of data, serving as a roadmap as you design your data collection tools and clean your data, in order to ultimately get to where you want to go.</description>

*Note: On 2022-12-12 I made a small update to the slides. I discovered that the codebookr::codebook() function did not create 2 of the summary statistics I originally thought it did. So the slides now reflect this finding.</description>

Name Label Type Values (if categorical) Value labels (if categorical) NA values (Missing values: for example -99 and -98) NA labels (Missing value labels: for example -99 = No response, -98 = Unclear response) Total valid N Total missing N N per value (if categorical) % per value (if categorical) N per NA value (Missing value) % per NA value (Missing value) Range (if continuous) Mean (if continuous) A table of all packages I reviewed can be found here: https://cghlewis.</description>

      <description>Everyone who works with data has experienced data management difficulties. While it is a pain in the moment to work through those issues, it is refreshing to know that you are never alone. This is evident from the several meetups that have even been started just to commiserate around shared data mishap experiences. Take for instance the Second Annual Data Mishaps Night occurring next Thursday February 24th, or the Be Afraid, Be Very Afraid: Data Management Horror Stories and Lessons Learned sharing session occurring at the COS: Unconference next Friday, February 25th.</description>

      <description>Thank you to all the folks who have contributed both technical and creative skills to this project:
Desirée De Leon 🦒 (designed 5 of the custom color themes, made illustrations for the workshop, and provided general aesthetic feedback along the way)
Garrick Aden-Buie 🧙‍♀️ (debugged headroom.js and lent his panelset.js code to the theme)
Allison Horst 🐕 (awesome illustrations of campfires, seedlings, and evergreens, as well as my R Markdown hedgehog mascot 🦔)</description>
