      <description>This summer I&amp;rsquo;ve been consulting on some early phase education research projects. These are projects that have recently been funded and are going into their first year of data collection. The people I consult with have reached out because they really want to set up good data management practices early on, saving them from potentially having to clean up data disasters later on. Coming in as a consultant, rather than a full-time employee, I find that my role is really to narrow in on what are the core priorities.</description>

      <title>Creating unique participant study identifiers</title>

      <description>I recently had a discussion with a colleague about assigning unique participant identifiers in their study. In that discussion I learned that my opinion on how researchers should assign identifiers happened to be very different from how this colleague was assigning identifiers. This discussion then prompted me to question my assumptions about how I manage data (which I appreciate)! :)
For several hours after this discussion I scoured the internet for any advice, research, or opinions on how participant identifiers should be assigned.</description>
